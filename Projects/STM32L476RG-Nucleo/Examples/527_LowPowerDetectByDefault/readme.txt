This example only supports Type A, B,F,V communication. It enters by default into low power mode and will go into normal polling mode when card detected. It allows to reenter the low power mode by pressing user button.   

This example code is based on en-X-CUBE-NFC5.zip(STM32CubeExpansion_NFC5_V2.0.0), IDE used is Keil V5.

To execute the example code, please follow the following procedure:

1. Please download the source code on the ST website(ST account needed):
https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mcu-mpu-embedded-software/stm32-embedded-software/stm32cube-expansion-packages/x-cube-nfc5.html

2. Unzip the folder to get STM32CubeExpansion_NFC5_V2.0.0 original version

3. Unzip the example code and copied it to the example folder(eg..\...\STM32CubeExpansion_NFC5_V2.0.0\Projects\STM32L476RG-Nucleo\Examples\xxxx)

4. Rebuild ALL the project and enjoy!
