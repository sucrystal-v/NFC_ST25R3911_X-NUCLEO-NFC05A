@par Description

This directory contains a set of source files that implement a simple example based on 
ST25R3911

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.



@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example runs on STM32L053R8, STM32L476RG and STM32F401RE devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics:
    STM32L4xx-Nucleo RevC
    STM32F4xx-Nucleo RevC
    STM32L0xx-Nucleo RevC	
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32L4Xxx-Nucleo, STM32F4xx-Nucleo RevC STM32L0xx-Nucleo RevCSet-up    
    - Connect the Nucleo board to your PC with a USB cable type A to mini-B 
      to ST-LINK connector (CN1).
    - Please ensure that the ST-LINK connector CN2 jumpers are fitted.

        
    
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the application
